# Concepts

## The Mean Value Theorem

Lef $$f$$ be a function that satisfies the following hypotheses:

1. $$f$$ is continuous on the closed interval $$[a, b]$$.
2. $$f$$ is differentiable on the open interval $$(a, b)$$.

Then there is a number $$c$$ in $$(a, b)$$ such that

$$f^{'}(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

or, equivalently,

$$f(b) - f(a) = f^{'}(c)(b - a)$$

# Questions

Consider the following function and closed interval.

$$f(x) = x^{3} - 3x + 4, [-2, 2]$$

## Question 1

Find $$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$ for $$[a, b] = [-2, 2]$$. (If an answer does not exist, enter DNE.)

$$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = ?$$

## Question 2

If the mean value theorem can be applied, find all values of $$c$$ that satisfy the conclusion of the mean value theorem. (Enter your answers as a comma-separated list. If it does not satisfy the hypotheses, enter DNE).

$$c = ?$$
