## 내용

A circular steel rod of length $$L$$ and diameter $$d$$ hangs in a mine shaft and holds an ore bucket of weight $$W$$ at its lower end.

(a) Obtain a formula for the maximum stress $$\sigma_{max}$$ in the rod, taking into account the weight of the rod itself.

(b) Calculate the maximum stress if $$L=40m, d=8mm$$, and $$W=1.5kN$$.
