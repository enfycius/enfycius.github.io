## Question 1

At 2:00 p.m. a car's speedometer reads 50$$km/h$$. At 2:20 p.m. it reads 65$$km/h$$. Show that at some time between 2:00 and 2:20 the acceleration is exactly 45$$km/h^{2}$$.

Let $$v(t)$$ be the velocity of the car $$t$$ hours after 2:00 p.m. Then $$\frac{v(1/3) - v(0)}{1/3 - 0} = ?$$. By the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number $$c$$ such that $$0 < c < ?$$ with $$v^{'}(c) = ?$$. Since $$v^{'}(t)$$ is the acceleration at time $$t$$, the acceleration $$c$$ hours after 2:00 p.m. is exactly 45 $$km/h^{2}$$.
